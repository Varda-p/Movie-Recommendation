This is a movie recommendation system built on AWS SageMaker. 
The recommender system is built for three different models- 
1. Content Based Model: This recommends the top 10 movies to the user using the similarity matrix technique. 
2. User-Based Model:This model recommends top 10 personalized movies to the user. The clustering technique is used for this purpose. 
3. Factorization Machine Model: The factorization machine model is an built-in model in SageMaker. It was used to calculate the prediction sof the movies recommended.

The AWS features such as IAM, CloudWatch, EC2, S3 buckets, jupyter notebooks were used in the project.
